DateVision is an end-to-end deep learning solution built using PyTorch for the Kaggle competition "Open Data Day 2025: Dates Types Classification." This project classifies images of date fruits into seven distinct categories:

Ajwa
Medjool
Meneifi
Nabtat Ali
Shaishe
Sokari
Sugaey
Project Overview
This project leverages state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to preprocess, train, and evaluate a model that accurately distinguishes between different types of date fruits. The model is trained on a labeled dataset, and predictions are generated for a test set of 126 images. The final output is a CSV file formatted for submission to Kaggle.
